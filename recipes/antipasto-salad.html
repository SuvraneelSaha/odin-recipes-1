  <h3 class="recipe-description">
    An antipasto is a cold platter of meat, cheese, and vegetables which is
    served at the start of a meal before the pasta and other courses, but to
    save some time, I thought we'd add the pasta right into the antipasto to
    turn into a complete meal all by itself. You could serve this as a side
    dish, but with a hunk of crusty bread and a glass of wine, I'm not sure
    what else you'd need. Top with more parsley before serving.

  <h4 class="recipe-directions">Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul class="recipe-ul">
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="recipe-directions">For the Dressing:</h4>
  <ul class="recipe-ul">
    <li>1 clove garlic, finely crushed</li>
    <li>1 anchovy fillet</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
    <li>½ cup red wine vinegar, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="recipe-directions">For the Salad:</h4>
  <ul class="recipe-ul">
    <li>⅓ cup julienned red onion</li>
    <li>⅓ cup julienned jalapeno pepper</li>
    <li>⅓ cup julienned pickled pepperoncini peppers</li>
    <li>½ cup julienned fire-roasted red pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup quartered baby artichoke hearts</li>
    <li>½ cup sliced black olives</li>
    <li>½ cup sliced green olives</li>
    <li>¼ pound salami, julienned</li>
    <li>¼ pound pepperoni, julienned</li>

    <li>¼ pound provolone cheese, julienned</li>

    <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, quartered</li>
  </ul>
  <ol class="recipe-ol">
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in the
      boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
      about 12 minutes. Drain thoroughly in a colander, but do not rinse; stir
      to release heat. Allow to cool in the colander for 5 to 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      While pasta cools, add garlic and anchovy to a large mixing bowl. Use a
      whisk or fork to crush the anchovy and garlic into a paste. Add Dijon
      mustard, mayonnaise, vinegar, salt, pepper, oregano, and thyme and whisk
      to combine. Slowly drizzle in olive oil, whisking constantly, until
      dressing is smooth, thick, and coats the back of a spoon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pour cooled pasta into the bowl of dressing and toss with a large spoon
      until well coated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir red onion, jalapeno, pepperoncini, red pepper, artichokes, black
      olives, green olives into the salad. Add salami, pepperoni, and ham; mix
      thoroughly. Add Provolone cheese. Mix with a spoon thoroughly to
      combine. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, 3 to
      12 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove from the refrigerator, add chopped parsley and tomatoes, and mix
      thoroughly. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed.
